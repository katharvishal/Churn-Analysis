# Churn-Analysis
This project provides a comprehensive, end-to-end churn analysis solution using a combination of SQL Server, Power BI, and Python with machine learning. The primary goal is to analyze customer data to understand churn behavior, identify at-risk customers, and predict future churners. The project begins with the ETL process in a SQL Server database.

2. Short Description / Purpose
The purpose of the project is to identify which customers are likely to churn and provide insights to help businesses take preventive retention actions. The dashboard offers a clear view of churn metrics, behavior patterns, and predictions.

4. Tech Stack
• SQL Server & SSMS – Data storage, cleaning, and ETL.
• Power BI – Data transformation, modelling, and visualization.
• Python (Jupyter Notebook) – Creation of a Random Forest machine learning model for churn prediction.

6. Data Source
The dataset consists of customer demographics, account details, and service usage patterns relevant to churn analysis. The data is ingested into SQL Server for transformation and then imported into Power BI.

8. Features / Highlights
Business Problem:
Customer churn causes major revenue losses. The project aims to detect churn causes and identify customers at risk.

Goal of the Dashboard:
To provide an interactive dashboard summarizing churn KPIs and predictive insights.

*Walkthrough of Key Visuals:
- Summary Page with churn metrics.
- Prediction Page displaying high churn-risk customers.
- Visuals highlighting segment-wise churn patterns.

*Business Impact & Insights:
-By combining historical data analysis + predictive analytics, the project enables early identification of customers likely to churn — giving the business a chance to act (e.g. retention campaigns, personalized   offers) before churn happens.

-The dashboard also helps understand patterns and drivers of churn — e.g. which customer segments, behaviors or demographics have higher churn; which features correlate with churn — thus informing business        strategy around customer retention, product improvements, and resource allocation.

-For an analytics portfolio (or for a company), this integrated pipeline (ETL → BI → ML → Dashboard) demonstrates scalable and repeatable solution: one can feed new data periodically, update dashboards, and       continuously monitor churn, rather than doing ad-hoc analyses.-
